I landed in the plane and a sign behind me said 'Rammstein Flughafen'.
However smelt a delicious Gebaeck and walked towards the pastry shop.
I noticed a man, advertising an eating competition in front of the shop. Being the wettbewerbsfaehig person I am, I approached him.
I was a little scared at first when I saw the big hund by his side.
